## **Introduction**

This script securely handles encryption and decryption of data using **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** for symmetric encryption and **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** for asymmetric encryption. A key file is generated to manage the RSA key pair and AES encryption key, secured by an optional passphrase.

---

## **Features**

- **AES Encryption**: Encrypts and decrypts sensitive data or files.  
- **RSA Key Management**: Uses RSA public/private key pairs for secure key handling.  
- **Obfuscation**: Adds an extra layer of protection to the key file.  
- **File Encryption**: Encrypts and decrypts files directly.  
- **Integrity Protection**: Enhances AES key security with hash-based mechanisms.  

---

## **Requirements**

- **Python 3.x**  
- **cryptography library**: Install via `pip install cryptography`.  

---

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository or copy the script file to your project directory.  
2. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
   ```

---

## **Usage Guide**

### **Key File Initialization**

Before encryption or decryption, initialize a key file:  
1. Specify the key file path (e.g., `keyfile.key`).  
2. Set an optional passphrase to secure the key file.  

```python
initialize_key_file("keyfile.key", "your-secure-password")
```

### **Encrypting Data**

Use `encrypt_data` to encrypt strings or binary data:  

```python
encrypt_data("keyfile.key", "your-password", b"Your sensitive data")
```

### **Decrypting Data**

Retrieve and decrypt encrypted strings or binary data:  

```python
decrypt_data("keyfile.key", "your-password", "encrypted_data_string")
```

### **Encrypting Files**

Encrypt any file with the following function:  

```python
encrypt_file("keyfile.key", "your-password", "example.txt")
```

### **Decrypting Files**

Decrypt `.enc` files generated by the encryption process:  

```python
decrypt_file("keyfile.key", "your-password", "example.txt.enc")
```

---

## **How It Works**

### Key Management
1. RSA public and private keys are generated and saved in the key file.  
2. AES keys are randomly generated and encrypted using the RSA public key.  

### Encryption Process
- **AES** encrypts the data or file contents.  
- **RSA** secures the AES key for future decryption.  

### Obfuscation
- Key data is obfuscated using **Base64** encoding and string manipulation for added security.  

---

## **Security Measures**

- RSA encryption with **4096-bit keys** provides robust security.  
- AES encryption uses **256-bit keys** for data protection.  
- Key file is secured with a passphrase and hashed for integrity.  
- Data obfuscation adds an extra layer of complexity.
